#Ans
# n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))    
# # Here, we are declaring the integer variable to store the input rows  
# m = (2 * n) - 2     # Here, the m is used for number of spaces  
# # Here, we are declaring an outer loop to handle number of rows  
# for i in range(0, n):    
#      # Here, we are declaring an for loop to handle number of spaces  
#     for j in range(0, m):    
#         print(end=" ")    
#     m = m - 1      # Here, we are decrementing the m after each loop    
# # Here, we are declaring an outer loop to print the pattern      
# for j in range(0, i + 1):    
#         # Here, we are printing the full Triangle pyramid using stars
